Small mobile app developed during my time at univeristy in one of the modules. 
Used .NET Maui Framework

This app is named Workup, It's designed to be a study/work app in order to help users track projects with other helpful features.
This includes:
* tracking which projects the user wants to do
* Using a timer app (For things like the pomodoro technique)
* Keeping updates on the users progress so that they can see how they have progressed
* A calculator as an extra tool. 



Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/icons
Font Awesome was the site I used to make the small icons such as at the bottom bar of all the pages (The calculator, Gear Icon etc.)
